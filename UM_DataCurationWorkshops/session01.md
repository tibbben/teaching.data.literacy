- Show the variety of approaches to data management planning
- Critically evaluate existing Data Management Plans

**Preparation Before the Seminar**  

_Seek a call for grant applications in your discipline(s) and identify the requirements for articulating a data management plan. The big three funding agency pages are a good place to start:_

* The [NSF funding page](https://www.nsf.gov/funding/)
* The [NIH funding page](https://grants.nih.gov/funding/index.htm) 
* The [NEH grant opportunities page](https://www.neh.gov/grants)

_Find a DMP and read it before coming to the seminar_

* Choose a DMP to from https://dmptool.org/public_dmps. 
    - NOTE: “They are not vetted for quality, completeness, or adherence to funder guidelines.”
	- This collection is mostly comprised of data management plans for the NSF, _but there are several from the NEH and other independent agencies as well._
* Visit the NEH website and identify either data management or data sharing requirements  
    - The in 2015 the NEH [announced](https://www.neh.gov/divisions/odh/grant-news/data-management-plans-successful-grant-applications-2011-2014-now-available) a collection of publicly available DMP plans that can be found here. 
	- These plans are based on these [Data Management Plans guidelines](http://www.neh.gov/files/grants/data_management_plans_2015.pdf) publishied by the NEH in 2015.
* Use a DMP provided by a professor or student in your discipline if available (best option)`

**Lesson Plan**  

1. Introduce 
  - Data Curation
  - Data Life Cycle
2. Reflect for a moment - in your discipline(s) what is data? Can you visualize the cycle of data in a research project in your discipline(s)?
  - emphasize that any discipline should be able to do this, but there will be differences
