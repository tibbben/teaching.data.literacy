##Session 1 - grant writing requirements and the DMP tool

* October 21 10 am - 11:30 am
* October 28 10 am - 11:30 am

**Learning Objectives**
- Explain the data lifecycle with attention to understanding 'data' and 'management'
- Show the variety of approaches to data management planning
- Critically evaluate existing Data Management Plans

> Seek a call for grant applications in your discipline(s) and identify the requirements for articulating a data management plan  

* Choose a DMP to read from https://dmptool.org/public_dmps. NOTE: “They are not vetted for quality, completeness, or adherence to funder guidelines.”
* Use a DMP provided by a professor or student in your discipline  

> Alternatively visit government agency websites and identify either data management or data sharing requirements  

* for example, the NEH requirements: https://www.neh.gov/files/grants/data_management_plans_2016.pdf

**Lesson Plan**  
1. Introduce 
  - Data Curation
  - Data Life Cycle
2. Reflect for a moment - in your discipline(s) what is data? Can you visualize the cycle of data in a research project in your discipline(s)?
  - emphasize that any discipline should be able to do this, but there will be differences
