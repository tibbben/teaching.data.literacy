##Data Curation for Liaison Librarians
###University of Miami Libraries’ Internal Seminar Series

As a part of the data curation initiative, Tim Norris will offer a series of three seminars/workshops covering fundamental aspects of data curation for liaison librarians. The structure of the workshops will be as follows:  
* prior to each session you will inquire into one aspect of data curation for your respective discipline(s) (see below for individual topics).  
* In each session you will share out what you learned
* Additional information will be provided as needed

###Workshop Learning Goals
1. Articulate challenges that students and faculty face in grant writing
2. Explain challenges students and faculty face in depositing research results into a repository
3. Locate data curation resources for faculty and students here at the University of Miami

As a result of 1-3, identify data curation needs of faculty and students through direct interviews

###Important Note
Attendance to this series of active learning workshops is not required yet it is highly encouraged. You may feel that professors and students in your discipline do not collect _data_ or write grants with data management requirements, yet as digital technologies are adopted broadly across all disciplines the material covered in this active learning workshop series will be useful to all.
