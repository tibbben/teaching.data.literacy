###Important Note
Attendance to this series of active learning workshops is not required yet it is highly encouraged. You may feel that professors and students in your discipline do not collect _data_ or write grants with data management requirements, yet as digital technologies are adopted broadly across all disciplines the material covered in this active learning workshop series will be useful to all.
