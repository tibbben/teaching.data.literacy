Lesson 8
========

**Learning Objectives**
  - Describe purpose, domain, community, and function of metadata and identify categories in each
  - Identify and list the types of information typically included in metadata records
  - Design or identify a standardized process to document data throughout the research endeavor
  - Produce metadata that serves for discovery, re-use, publication, and archival needs

**Lesson Plan**
  
*__Class 1__*  

1. Housekeeping (5 minutes)
2. Introduction to Metadata (lecture 20 minutes)
  - quick note at the beginning: metadata for some is data for others . . . give the geographic metadata example
  - what is metadata, where does it fit in the research data lifecycle, what roles does it play
    - purposes (descriptive, structural, administrative)
    - functions (structure, vocabs, record formats, standards, frameworks)
    - domains (things, data, texts, video, photos, sounds, geospatial)
    - who does it serve ( archives, museam, library, onfo industry \[ what about scientists? \])
  - creation processes
  - ** pause **
    - reflect on a good understanding of a description, what it is
  - standard elements in metadata
    - introduce dublin core
  - how to structure the elements, schemas
  - close with quick review
3. Card Sorting Excercise (20 minutes)
  - NOTE: bring lots of note cards \[3x5 or bigger\] and a few sharpies to class
  - students get several cards on which they can write their acronyms from the homework
  - have them descibe the acronyms briefly and place them categorically under one or more of the following bins: purpose { Technical, descriptive, preservation, rights, structural }, function { structure, vocabulary, record format, framework, standard }, domain { cultural objects, datasets, geospatial, video, sound, texts, images }, community { archives, museum, library, Information Industry }
  - discuss (based on Riley's poster)
4. Elliot's guest lecture (20 minutes)

*__Class 2__*  

1. Housekeeping (5 minutes)
2. Example walkthrough (25 minutes)
  - look at the ecological dataset and two forms of metadata
    - think about two forms of metadata: what purpose they serve, how they funtion, their domain, and who they serve
  - [*http://esapubs.org/archive/instruct_d.htm*](http://esapubs.org/archive/instruct_d.htm)
    - [*http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/226/metadata.php*](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/226/metadata.php)
    - discuss human readable aspect of metadata
    - view source and look at machine readable aspects
  - [*http://dx.doi.org/10.5063/F1HD7SK1*](http://dx.doi.org/10.5063/F1HD7SK1)
    - same discussion here
    - look for kinds of metadata (descriptive, structrual, administrative)
3. Introduce more on git (continue software carpentry lesson: 30 minutes until end)
