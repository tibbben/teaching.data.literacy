**Lesson Plan**

*__Class 1__*  

1. Review readings (5 minutes)

3. Pair/Share activity - my data levels/formats (15 minutes)
  - draw their research cycle and attach data types/levels to each stage of the cycle (5 minutes)
  - share this with your neighbor (2 minutes)
  - share out good/bad/problems to class (5 minutes)
4. Introduce File Formats 
  - as a way of storing/encoding the different data types and levels
