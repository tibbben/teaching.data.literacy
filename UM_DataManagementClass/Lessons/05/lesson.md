**Lesson Plan**
  
*__Class 1__*  

1. Houskeeping (5 minutes)
  - by Wednesday, have their interviewee identified - discuss options
2. Introduction and Methodological Considerations (lecture 15 minutes)
  - really have them think for a momoent on computer failure - compare to loss of wallet or purse
  - have them think through the loss scenarios before showing - see if the get them all
  - backups
    - emphasize periodic snapshots that get erased over and over again, frequent schedule
  - archives
    - emphasize long term - checksum, decay, LOCKSS
  - emphasize: you can't save everything, introduce storage is cheap debate?
  - on the "don't forget" slide use opportunity to talk about file system organization (time and space, file types, structures and formats) and file naming conventions all in the context of the research data lifecycle.
  - on validation: admit that ithis is a hard habit, but important for some . . . think of examples together  . . . do a command line example
  - STOP on the Backup Media Options Slide (picture of the disk and the cloud)
3. share excercise (15 minutes or less)
  - describe to a partner your current backup strategy, partner write it down (3 minutes)
  - switch and do the same (3 minutes)
  - critique parter's and your strategy: identify weaknesses and strengths (2 minutes)
  - share (7 minutes)
4. Backup and storage media options and solutions (lecture 30 minutes)
  - on intro slide (disk and cloud) introduce idea of pros and cons, no magic solution, must be designed for your work flow
  - on magnetic tapes slide amphasize that this is still very common
  - on repositories, suggest they start exploring now (they have an assignment later as well)
    - also note the dulication of: data is accesible and visible
  - versioning - note that we will get into this later and do some hands-on learning with git
  - make sure they know who Richard Stallman is (GNU public license)
  - on the bottom line slide:
    - know that xfat is a disk format, not a file format
    - re-emphasize again, organization, naming, formats
5. End with on campus solutions and a transition to security
6. If there is time and curiosity, introduce command line sync tools

*__Class 2__*  

1. Security and Privacy
  - at start emphasize how security and storage are very related
2. Introduction to DCP assignment
  - review of major course components so far
