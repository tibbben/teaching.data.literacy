**Lesson Plan**
  
*__Class 1__*  

1. Houskeeping (5 minutes)
  - check in on progress, final projects overview due NOW!!
  - check in on coding
    - input/output, pipes and filters, loops, conditionals, functions
    - not hard to self learn (mention resources: online boards, stackoverflow, etc.)
2. Open Data (20 minutes)
  - Open access, open data, open source, open content, open knowledge
    - speak to data vs database
    - speak to open source, community source, proprietary (costs, who pays)
    - new economic model? 
    - open linked data???
  - Data Governance on the lifecycle
    - pretty much everywhere
    - always will be tensions (there is never a simple solution)
  - definitions
    - open data
    - open data characteristics (ideal vs. .gov) [from Kitchin]
  - Review: why and why not (research context)
    - seek solutions
    - all disciplines different
  - broader context (why and why not)
    - note that transparency should be in research context as well (taxes paid for research)
    - story of GPS receivers, 1984 made open, look at proliferation of business that benefitted
    - think also about remotely sensed data (high investment, but incredibly useful for MANY things)
    - lots of volunteer work, who benefits?
3. Software Licensing and Open Source Software (20 minutes)
  - take a moment and have them write down several things - discuss
    - what they think open source software is
    - who uses open source software
    - where you might find open source software (kinds of devices)
  - define - note similarities between open source and open data
    - data drew from longer open source community
  - talk about licensing
    - tell tale of GNU and Richard Stallman
      - free software foundation and drafting of GNU license
      - free, not as in free beer but as in free speech
    - GNU slightly more restrictive on redistribution must remain open (than BSD) - a form of "copyleft" (all derivatives must retain the same distribution license)
    - BSD - Berkeley Software Distribution
    - MIT perhaps most permissive, you can do anything but the liense must remain with the distribute/modifie copy
    - Apache - probably most restrictive, can still remain patented
  - examples of Open Source Software
    - linux
      - flavors
      - paid for services (support, updates, etc.)
    - apache
      - pretty much runs the internet
    - and so on
4. University of Miami Policy (20 minutes)
  - Introduce the Data Policy article - place UM on the tables (approx)
    - UM $309 Million in grants 2014-15
    - UM has approx. 3000 faculty
  - University Ownership (from Faculty Manual)
    - all research products (data included, but not explicit, there is work going on in office of research and in Library to make better policy)
    - software as an exception
  - Faculty Manual (on Data)
    - a little on hiring and promotion
    - mostly about misconduct and investigations into misconduct
  - Graduate Student Manual (on Data)
    - all about misconduct
